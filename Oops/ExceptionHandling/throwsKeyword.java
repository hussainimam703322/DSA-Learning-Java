/*
throws is a keyword in Java that is used in the signature of a method to indicate that
this method might throw one of the listed type exceptions. 
The caller to these methods has to handle the exception using a try-catch block. 
It can handle multiple exceptions along with the method signature
It is not handling the exceptions by itself rather it handling  the exceptions with functions
